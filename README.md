# Ubuntu ZFS Root

Script to facilitate installing Ubuntu on a ZFS root.

## Inspiration

[Ubuntu 18.04 Root on ZFS
](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Ubuntu-18.04-Root-on-ZFS) as of 2018-11-16.

## Motivation

Provide a script to install Ubuntu on ZFS side by side with Windows 10. Instructions in the link above describe how to do this using Ubuntu for the whole disk.

## Status

This project is deprecated and the code moved to [https://github.com/HankB/Linux_ZFS_Root](https://github.com/HankB/Linux_ZFS_Root). After installing Ubuntu on a test system I decided I wanted to try Debian as well so I renamed the project
and the code from this repo has been copied into another project.
